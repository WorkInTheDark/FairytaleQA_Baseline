# FairytaleQA_Baseline
Code for paper ```Fantastic Questions and Where to Find Them: FairytaleQAâ€” An Authentic Dataset for Narrative Comprehension```
We have a separate Repository for the FairytaleQA Dataset here: ...

### Todo List
- [ ] Provide model checkpoints used in the paper
- [x] Provide code to predict/evaluate QA (Question Answering) Baseline
- [x] Provide code to predict/evaluate QG (Question Generation) Baseline

This repo contains all the dependencies for the baseline QA/QG experiments, except for the model checkpoint because of size limit.
You may find the model checkpoints for the baseline results below:
* xxx
* xxx

```Github_QA&QG_generate_answers_on_test_val.ipynb``` is the notebook used for the QA/QG generation. After cloning this repo in the first cell, you need to put the model checkpoint in ```./models```. If you are using Google Colab, also remember to restart the runtime after installing the dependencies (Colab will have an automatic prompt as well).

he was too old and feeble to carry the big and heavy box .
helped him put it on his back .
the old man had to put up with the unkindness of his wife .
his wife was even crosser than usual .
to pacify her .
gold and silver coins and many other precious things .
give up work and live in ease and comfort the rest of his days .
overjoyed .
she thought there would have been more treasure .
she could not suppress the greed of her wicket nature .
she screamed .
she was greedy and mean .
she made up her mind to get more .
the cruel way she had treated her in cutting off her tongue in a fit of rage .
trick her .
dislike .
hastened to the door and knocked loudly .
the lady sparrow was a polite bird .
she was rude .
the old woman could not walk fast, much less run .
she supposed the big box would be full of gold and silver and precious jewels .
a number of horrible and frightful looking demons .
frightened .
bounced out of the box and surrounded her as if they intended to kill her .
ran from the spot as fast as her quaking legs would carry her .
the sparrow had punished her .
the giant's garden .
stop their games in order to listen to them .
the giant .
run away .
they were scared .
he did not want anyone in his garden .
tried to play on the road, used to wander round the high wall when their lessons were over, and talk about the beautiful garden inside .
so glad .
a little boy .
he was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the tree .
the children weren't there .
the kids were so frightened that they all ran away .
his eyes were so full of tears that he did not see the giant coming .
the tree broke at once into blossom and the birds came and sang on it .
the giant grew very old and feeble .
the giant ran downstairs in great joy, and out into the garden .
the little child .
paradise .
he did not allow anybody to play in his garden but himself .
he realized that he was selfish .
knocked down the wall .
sad .
the son of a poor family .
the wild people .
promised them their daughters in marriage .
her parents did not like him, and would seek to do him harm .
his wife's parents, with kind words and friendly gestures, kept urging him to help himself .
her parents had evil plans .
the son-in-law thought that surely his wife's parents could mean him no ill .
angry .
the son-in-law had never yet seen such an appetizing dish .
felt terrible pains, which soon grew unbearable, so that he fell to the ground unconscious .
the birthday noodles were poisonous worms and centipedes .
her parents knew that her husband did not die, and they would think up other evil plans .
climb the phenix's next and fetch him the eggs .
flung loaves of bread into the air .
the great dragon ate all of the eggs .
terrified .
in the middle kingdom .
his wife told him to throw loaves of bread .
a dragon will appear .
kneeled and begged his wife pitifully to save his life .
a violent mountain rain suddenly began to fall .
his wife fell out of the umbrella .
pearls and precious stones .
looked around without being able to see his wife .
a white cock, seven black tea-cups, and half a length of red nettlecloth .
undid the bag of pearls and jewels, bought a piece of good ground, built a fine house, and became wealthy and respected members of the community .
the wife's mother .
the wife's father .
took the black tea-cups and threw them at it .
sad .
a snake and a great black raven .
twisted himself round the neck of the raven .
the king's son drawn his sword, and cut off the head of the snake at a single blow .
showed him a sight .
his sister's house .
had meat of each meat, and drink of each drink, warm water for his feet, and a soft bed to lie in .
the handsomest youth that ever was seen .
the great black raven .
go back by the road he came, and lie as before, a night in each house .
the bundle seemed to grow heavier .
a great castle with an orchard .
a huge giant coming towards him .
the first boy he had when he was seven years old .
the castle and the orchard were tied up in the bundle again .
had left the bundle unloosed till he had reached the green valley close to his father's palace .
there stood within the most beautiful maiden that ever was seen .
got married .
he was happy with his wife .
he remembered his promise, and remembered, too, that he had told the queen nothing about it .
leave the matter between her and the giant .
the cook's son .
the cook's son gave him the wrong answer .
scared .
the butler's son .
asked him a question .
mad .
the king and queen gave him their son .
like his own son .
the top of the castle .
he needed to talk to the girl .
one of his two elder daughters .
the youngest .
mad .
clean the byre .
the byre .
the girl had disappeared, and the byre was so clean that a golden apple could roll from end to end of it .
thatch this byre with a feather from every different bird .
he needed their feathers .
never a bird was to be seen that day .
midday .
the byre was thatched .
collect five eggs .
the loch .
the bark was quite smooth .
the rising sun shone red on the trunk .
he could not climb the tree .
laid a finger against the tree and bade him put his foot on it .
her father's breath was burning her back .
her little finger .
the one whose right hand has no little finger .
the giant allowed him to marry the youngest daughter .
green silk of the same fashion, and with golden circlets round their heads .
the eggs .
little finger .
everyone grew tired and the guests went away .
her father would kill him .
cut an apple into nine pieces, and put two pieces at the head of the bed, and two pieces at the foot, and two pieces at the door of the kitchen, and two at the big door, and one outside the house .
crept out softly and stole across to the stable .
the blue-grey mare .
she needed to trick the giant .
put his hand into the ear of the mare and whatever he found there, throw it behind him .
there sprung up twenty miles of thornwood .
he needed to cut through the thornwood .
the hoodie .
a splinter of grey stone .
frustrated .
he was too focused on chasing his daughter and the king's son .
he had to break the rock .
a tiny bladder full of water .
the giant could not stop himself, and he walked right into the middle and was drowned .
the king's son never returned back to his wife .
the wife of a shoemaker .
the jug struck against the stones and broke in pieces .
his wife and daughter could not bring back water .
offered her to stay at his home .
to wear at the wedding .
a hundred pounds .
bring his purse with him .
he could not move from the place where he was; and there he stayed till many hours had passed by .
give her a drink from the well .
see if the latch is on the door .
his fingers stuck to it, and there he had to stay for many hours .
the purse of gold .
the sight of the king's son before he married .
he must carry the shoes for the wedding .
a flame went up out of it, and out of the flame sprang two pigeons, one of gold and one of silver .
she used the pigeons to talk about their past together .
the king's son understood that they had come to remind him of what he had forgotten, and his lost memory came back, and he knew his wife, and kissed her .
the preparations had been made, it seemed a pity to waste them .
no child had heaven sent .
he was very poor .
went forth into the woods and hills .
selling the things he made out of bamboo .
there was a bright soft light in the woods .
astonishment .
hollow in the green bamboo stem .
a tiny human being .
three inches in height .
he found him here among the bamboos where lies his daily work .
happy .
the old woman put her into a basket .
loving the tiny girl .
he found precious stones and gold in bamboo .
built himself a fine house .
the bamboo child had become a full-grown girl .
she was of such wondrous beauty .
she made people feel happy .
her body gave forth so much soft bright light that she might have been a daughter of the moon god .
the naming of princess moonlight .
many were the suitors who desired to win her hand or even so much to see her .
her parents kept her hidden away .
they wanted to see her beauty .
obstacles .
letters .
he was not her real father .
he lent a willing ear to their tale of love .
distress .
she had no wish to marry .
her beauty .
his heart might change afterwards .
she wanted proof of their devotion .
excited .
the stone bowl which had belonged to buddha .
they were disheartened and disgusted at what seemed to them the impossibility of the tasks given to them .
they resolved to make an attempt to get what she desired of them .
traveling was very difficult and full of danger .
he was too afraid to travel to india .
it did not shine at all .
mount horai belonged to the land of fable and not fact .
took his journey home and tried to make himself look as if he were wearied and worn out with travel .
she knew the second knight was lying .
the six jewelers sent in a petition to the princess to be paid for their labor .
anger .
he paid his friend in china to get it for him .
his friend did not get him the real fire-rat .
they considered it impossible .
repaired his house and fitted it up beautifully for the reception of the princess .
sent messengers with a letter inviting him to his house .
he wanted to make her one of the ladies-in-waiting .
vanish from the earth .
she did not want to be seen .
leave her free .
any one on this earth .
her friends from the moon would come fetch her and she would have to return .
to think of leaving her kind foster-parents and the home where she had been happy for so long .
he was sad his daughter was leaving .
make prisoners of the envoys from the moon .
nothing could prevent them from carrying out their purpose .
a band of luminous beings .
the chief .
barbaik bourhis .
seen in the fields or in the dairy, milking cows, making butter, feeding fowls; working hard themselves and taking care that others worked too .
she grew to love money for its own sake, and only gave herself and tephany the food and clothes they absolutely needed .
young denis .
she found tephany talking outside the cowhouse to young denis .
he wasn't rich .
take a farm for himself .
angry .
sad .

stupefied .
the little old woman did not know her .
long copper pin .
mother bourhis will be obliged to leave the house in order to go and count her cabbages .
leave the pin in her dress .
a fairy .
the little old woman was wise in telling what could happen in the days to come .
she had her pin from the little old woman .
to make up for lost time .
the cowhouse .
barbaik took up her sabots or wooden shoes and went through the orchard and past to the fields, to the plot where the cabbages grew .
happy .
she saw plainly that he no longer cared for her as he used to do .
he was fond of talking himself, but not of listening to any one else .
he had nothing more to say to her .
put her water-pot on her shoulder and went slowly down to the spring .
he made excuses to stay away .
tephany was unhappy .
amuse him and to keep him with her .
this feather .
tephany wanted to win denis's love again .
grateful .
stick it in her hair .
surprised .
there was nothing that she did not seem to know , and as for songs she not only could sing those from every part of brittany, but could compose them herself .
tephany had not been able to resist the pleasure of putting the feather in her hair for some of the people who despised her .
her poor clothes .
denis began to lose interest in her .
he always liked to be master wherever he went .
thought that his turn would come next .
denis wanted to leave for a dance .
aziliez of pennenru .
men wanted beauty .
flung the feather from her hair .
tephany was not happy with denis .
this necklace .
took the necklace, and snapping the clasp ran to the mirror which hung in the corner .
none could be as fair and white as she .
she wanted to see denis at the dance .
a young man .
she wanted to be denis's wife .
there was not a girl in his own country that could be compared to her .
the young man took her to his castle .
a splendid castle .
worried .
will prepare to hold a wedding .
she used the fairy's gifts .
a farm .
the men started to fight over her .
she heard someone chasing after her .
scared .
she heard the footsteps cease from pursuing her and run after the pig .
surprise and joy .
he was not comfortable around her .
she wanted to be rich .
it made life easy for both herself and others .
she made the wrong wishes .
a small box .
rubbed her eyes with it .
angry .
she saw that each tear-drop was a round and shining pearl .
she was greedy .
astonished .
she did not want to share with others .
frustrated .
forced back her tears, and wiped her eyes .
her apron .
she wanted more pearls .
they wanted to find out the value of the pearls .
startled .
the feather, the pin, and the box .
her life was worse after using the gifts .
she married denis .

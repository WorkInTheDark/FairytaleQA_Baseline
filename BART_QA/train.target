cast peats on a piece of moorland that lay on a certain part of the farm .
the famous enchanter had once taken up his abode there .
set to work with all his might and main .
quite a quantity of peat .
he was startled by the appearance of the very smallest woman that he had ever seen in his life .
astonished .
stopped working, stuck his spade into the ground, and gazed at her in wonder .
the poor man ruined her home .
put back that turf instantly .

scared .
the poor man had often heard of the fairy folk and of the harm that they could work to unthinking mortals who offended them .
set to work to undo all his labour, and to place every divot in the exact spot from which he had taken it .
she will vanish completely .
put up his spade, he wended his way homewards, and going straight to his master, he told him the whole story, and suggested that in future the peats should be taken from the other end of the moor .

bewildered .
he did not listen to the fairy's warning .
accompanied him, encircling him in a magic ring, out of which he could in no way go .
rose and tried to walk away from them .
he found himself waltzing and whirling, sliding and bowing, as if he had done nothing else but dance all his life .
some strange magic seemed to enter into his veins .
he forgot about his home and his children. he felt so happy that he had no longer the slightest desire to leave the fairies' company .
happy .
crowded together and rushed towards the crag, dragging the countryman along in their midst .
they heard a cock from the farmyard crowing .
danced and danced as if they were mad .
they needed to go home .
rested .
sat down on a piece of rock in the corner, wondering what would happen next .
a mysterious door opened in it of its own accord, and shut again with a crash as soon as the fairy host had all trooped through .
he was put under a spell .
began to go about their household occupations, and to carry out certain curious practices which he had never seen before .
speak about the certain practices that the fairies did .
she trapped him for seven years .
he ruined her home .

by a dexterous use of the vine .

happy .
in a little cottage by the sea-shore .
catching seals and selling their fur .
it was not difficult to creep up behind them and kill them .

roane .
mermen and merwomen .
their skins were so big that he got an extra price for them .
to breathe the air .
the creature slipped off the rock into the sea, and disappeared under the water, carrying the knife along with it .
annoyed .

a horseman .
asked him his trade .
ordered a great number of seal skins .
delighted .

agreed to this, and climbed up behind the rider .
surprised .
frightened .
push him into the sea .
instead of being choked by the water, he could breathe quite easily. he and his companion, who was still close at his side, seemed to be sinking as quickly down through the sea as they had flown through the air .
a huge hall .
he had  assumed the form of a seal .
saw that he also no longer bore the likeness of a man, but was transformed into a nice, hairy, brown seal .
a seal was injured .
his hunting-knife .
horrified .
fell upon his face and begged for mercy .
he believed that the seals were angry at him for harming his comrade .
they crowded round him, rubbing their soft noses against his fur to show their sympathy, and implored him not to put himself about .
they will ask him for his help .
in a smaller room .
the guide's father .
the stranger wanted the seal catcher to heal his father .
went over to the bed, and, stooping over the wounded merman, washed and dressed the hurt as well as he could .
the old seal was better .
happy .
laughed, and they talked, and they embraced each other in their own strange way, crowding round their comrade. they rubbed their noses against his .
they wanted to show him how delighted they were at his recovery .
worried .
release him .
take a solemn oath never to wound a seal again .
overjoyed .
he was the most noted seal catcher in the north .
bade the strange company farewell, and, accompanied by his guide .
their strange disguise dropped from them. they were now as they had been before .
a huge bag of gold .
the stranger took away his job .
carried the bag into his cottage, and turned the gold out on the table .
in south of scotland, near the border, not very far from longtown .

king arthur and his knights .
a venerable man .
rode along at a snail's pace, thought over the bargains which he had made at the fair that day, and wondered when he was likely to dispose of his two remaining horses .
surprised .
agreed to buy the animals, and, pulling a bag of gold from the pocket of his queerly cut breeches, he began to count out the price .
surprised .
unicorns, and bonnet-pieces, and other ancient coins .
the coins were not the gold that was used at the time .
it was good, pure gold .
commissioned dick to get him other good horses at the same price .
the only stipulation he made being that dick should always bring them to the same spot, after dark, and that he should always come alone .
lead it over bowden moor after dark, and he was sure to meet the mysterious, white-headed stranger .
the old man never provided him with something to drink .
he wanted to have refreshments .
the stranger gave him a warning .
he never remembered having seen any opening in the hillside there before? .
scared .
an enormous cavern lit by flaming torches .
follow the old man up the hall to the far end of it .
thomas the rhymer .
the stranger wanted to reveal his identity .
the horn .
nervous .
the spirits might believe he was a threat .
thunder rolled in crashing peals through the immense hall .
sprang to their feet and seized their swords, brandishing them round their heads .
stamped, and snorted, and ground their bits, as if eager to escape from their stalls .
he was terrified at seeing so many threatening faces turned towards him .
made one weak, undecided effort to pick up the sword .
a perfect whirlwind of cold, raw air tore through the cavern, carrying the luckless horse-dealer along with it; and, hurrying him along the narrow passage through which he had entered, dashed him down outside on a bank of loose stones and shale .
whispered the story of his weird and fearful adventure .
one leg looped up to his thigh, so that he was obliged to get along by hopping .
aggo dah gauda .
secure his daughter from being carried off by the king of the buffalos .
in great state, having a log house of his own, and a court-yard which extended from the sill of his front-door as many hundred miles westward as he chose to measure it .

labored with great zeal .
he fasted from all food, and having thus purified his spirit and cleared his voice .
to pleasure aggo's daughter's palate .
to give to aggo's daughter every thing that she wanted .
aggo's indignation was so thoroughly awakened that he would have forthwith torn every hair from his head .
his single leg should never know rest again until he had found his beautiful daughter and brought her home .
there having been a frosty night or two since, the water was so covered with thin ice that aggo could not venture upon it .
encamped hard by till it became more solid .
she purposely had branches broken off and strewed behind .
twigs .
she appeared to relent in her heart .
aggo dah gauda with his daughter in his arms .
take aggo dead or alive .
to be outstripped by a man with one leg tied up .
the buffalos were driven half out of their wits .
he lost at last all patience at the absurd idea of chasing a man with one leg all night long .
the king never more appeared in all that part of the country .
relieved .
a very worthy young warrior .
the young warrior was not the owner of any more of the buffalos than a splendid skin robe which he wore .
he wanted to marry her .
angry .
he would not be there to protect her .
bored .
he loved her .
unhappy .
they did not want the pain of instant death .
sad .
to get the king a drink of water .
the daughter was willing to submit to him .
aggo only had one leg .
aggo would hop to be in contact with another herd .
his daughter was marrying a very worthy young warrior .
an old man .
the old woman .
she had a curious habit of disappearing in the gloaming and staying out all night .
she looked quite white and tired, as if she had been travelling far, or working hard .
watched her carefully .
scared .
she always slipped out of the door when he was not looking, and before he could reach it to follow her, she had vanished utterly .
asked her to tell him straight out whether she were a witch or no .
scared .
answered that she was .
the next time that she went on one of her midnight expeditions she would tell him all about it .
it seemed to him just as well that he should know all about his wife's cantrips .
his wife vanished. nor did she return till daybreak next morning .
the very next week the moon was new .
met at the old kirk on the moor and had mounted branches of the green bay tree and stalks of hemlock .

tried to persuade her with all the soft words he could think of .
he followed his wife and her friends .
up the chimney he went, and flew through the air after his wife and her companions, as if he had been a warlock born .
he hoped his and her friends would meet there .
witches are not in the habit of looking over their shoulders .
the bishop's palace .
not too well pleased .
they knew that if they wanted to get home before cock-crow it behoved them to keep their heads clear .
he sipped, and he sipped, until at last he became quite drowsy, and lay down on the floor and fell fast asleep .
she departed without waking him .
she did not want him to be so curious in the future .
the servants dragged him up to the light and shook him, and cuffed him, and asked him how he came to be there .
confused .
astonished .
the husband told them that he travelled on the midnight wind .
terrified .
bishops in those days had a holy horror of warlocks and witches .
scared .
wished with all his heart that he had stayed quietly at home in bed, and never hankered after the bishop's wine .
the poor old man thought that his last hour had come .
his wife came to save him .
for to him it was the croak of no earthly bird, but the voice of his wife whispering words of magic to him .
happy .

surprised .
he needed to say these words to escape .

there was a spell casted over him .
scared .
an old and grizzled goblin .
stopped at the edge of it; then, stooping down and pretending to pick up something, he whispered in a hoarse whisper .
he was warning him to leave .
he made a vow .
stepped over the edge of the circle .
shouted louder than ever, and danced more madly, and sang more lustily .
parted into two companies, leaving a way through their midst, up which they signed to the earl to pass .
lifted it from the table, and handed it to him with a stately bow .
the knight seated at a table of red marble .
the ale in the goblet never grew less .
concerned .
he will fall down .
they wanted him to spend many years with them .
happy .
scared .
the sound of human footsteps .
their keen ears heard a sound which filled their hearts with dread .
the human footsteps were so free and untrammelled .
he might work them ill, and rescue their captive from them .
earl st. clair .
the charmed ring and the eldrich dancers .
came and whispered to him .
the grizzled goblin did not want him to have the same faith as his companion .
followed the elfin knight here, and drank his heather ale .
remain motionless in the cold and frost till dawn break and the hour come .
his companion would turn into a goblin .
he bore the sign of one who was stronger than he .

he had the power of the blessed sign on his arm .
surprised .
all the ghostly elves and goblins whom he had seen, were lying frozen into tiny blocks of ice .
he was frozen too .
two coal-black ravens .
rose in the air and circled round his head, screaming with rage, and threatening to dash it from his hands with their claws .
stirred in their sleep, and half sat up .
the power of the holy sign restrained them .
the awful monster .
shrieks from the ravens, screams of the goblins, and the deep breaking of the awful monster .
he trusted in the might of the sign he bore .
flung the enchanted goblet from him .
every one of the frozen elves vanished, along with their king and his marble table .
earl gregory  slowly woke from his enchanted slumber .
nothing but a piece of rough grey whinstone, with a drop of dew hidden in a little crevice .
earl st. clair was trying to warm him up .
by the death of their parents .
the father had withdrawn many years before from the body of the tribe, and had lived ever since in a solitary place .
a knowledge of hunting and the pursuit of game .
the eldest .
so that each should become a master over a particular animal which was assigned to him .

kill each a male of that kind of animal .
a particular animal which was assigned to him .
they will be straightway filled with arrows .
he will have the privilege of acting as entertainer to the others .
maidwa .
the red hue still crimsoned the air, and tinged every object that he looked on--the tree-tops, the river that flowed, and the deer that glided away along the edge of the forest--with its delicate splendor .
the shore of a lake .
took no effect .
he longed to possess so glorious a creature .
a most beautiful red swan .
in their deceased father's medicine-sack were three magic arrows .
maidwa .
the swan must by this time have taken wing .
instead of seeing it droop its neck and drift to the shore, the red swan flapped its wings, rose slowly, and flew off with a majestic motion toward the falling sun .
the third was borne off .
master of the swan .
felling trees .
the watchman .
mend them and bring in maidwa's bundle .
he was so warmly received .
maidwa snatched them from her hand and hung them up himself .

an old man .
warming his back before the fire .

it was still again filled and refilled till his hunger was entirely satisfied .
he helped himself to all that was in the pot .
the one maidwa will see after one of the old man's fellow old men .
slept .
prepare breakfast .
he expected to meet the one who was to give him directions how to proceed to get the red swan .
it would make a passing remark, or sing a little tune for itself .
the daughter of a magician .
the magician's wampum-cap .
the daughter will recover .
the crown of his head was bare and bloody .
he will receive the red swan as his reward .
by the groans he would hear far over the prairie .
the magician would urge maidwa to attempt the recovery of his scalp .
invited maidwa to help himself .
the red swan .
the old magician commenced telling him how he had lost his scalp, the insults it was receiving, the pain he suffered thereby, his wishes to regain it, the many unsuccessful attempts that had already been made, and the numbers and power of those who retained it .
maidwa's dreams, or what he saw in his sleep .
when the magician heard the ka-kak cries of the hawk .
prepare his head and lean it out through the door .
the shouts of a great many people .
in the middle of the plain .
a humming-bird .
the scalp was moving away .
the weight was almost too great for him to bear up .
he remembered the instructions of maidwa .
gave the magician a severe blow on the head with the wampum scalp .
his strength returned and in a little while he rose and stood upon his feet .
ample presents of wampum, fur, robes, and other costly things .
regret .
the red swan met maidwa's gaze .
the red swan .
a present .
joy .
the kettle .
engaged in coloring a girdle .
various costly articles--wampum, robes, and trinkets, of much richness and value .
a foolish fellow .
he thought to have got this chief's daughter for a wife .
maidwa's brothers had been to their town in search of him, but that they had gone back some time before, having given up all hopes of ever seeing him again .
the pretender jumped up in a passion .
he took his great war-club and tapped this clownish fellow upon the head .

the buffalos addressed him as human beings .
a place where a living man has never before been .
maidwa will find the magic arrow at the lodge-door .
the dark cloud .
the possession of maidwa's wife .
shameful .
the silent kettle straightway served them up so hearty and wholesome a meal .
maidwa will live to a very old age and die happily .
they loved him .
he broke the agreement .
angry .
the arrows were bequeathed to him by his father .
proud .

the history of the fairy journey, of the theft of the young lady, of the figure he had seen laid in its place, of her life with his mother in fannet, of last halloween, and of the three drops that had released her from her enchantments .
with every distinction .
he saved her from the fairies, and has worked for her ever since .
in a coach-and-four .
in the grand dublin house .

she wanted to sift some meal .
pointed out to him the path that he was to follow, and told him that he would have no difficulty in finding the house .
he would be sure to see the light in the window .
his foot tripped, and he fell down .
he left it and walked towards the light .
a fairy parlour .
grinding corn between two flat millstones .
surprised .
bowed gravely and bade him be seated .
he will ask to join them .
he forgot his errand, he forgot his home, he forgot everything that had ever happened to him, he only knew that he wanted to remain with the fairies all the rest of his life .
a magic spell will be cast over him .
come and go at nights without being seen, and could sip the dew from the grass and honey from the flowers as daintily and noiselessly .
intended to pay a visit to the man in the moon .
he did not look where he was going .
his companions sped merrily on, not noticing what had befallen him .
a word of blessing rose to his lips .
made haste to go to the farm .
he felt sure that some weeks must have elapsed since he set out to fetch it .
his friends at home, and to the new mistress whom he had left waiting for her sieve .
they did not notice what had befallen him .
the neighborhood .
there were woods where no woods used to be, and walls where no walls used to be .
he could not find his way to the farm, and, worst of all, in the place where he expected to find his father's house he found nothing but a crop of rank green nettles .
looked about for someone to tell him what it all meant .
he will not be able to find his home .
asked him if he could tell him where his friends had gone to, and what had happened to his father's dwelling .
another old man .
a cottage .
frightened .
pointed with a twisted finger, to a leathern purse, or sporran .
he saw a tiny shrivelled face crowned by a red pirnie, looking over the edge of the sporran .
took the little creature out carefully between his finger and thumb, and set him on the palm of his left hand .
they were all dead long before he was born .
he got such a shock at the thought that his bones suddenly dissolved into dust, and he fell, a heap of grey ashes, on the floor .

he was in great distress at night for the want of food .
the figure of a human being .
the terrible witch .
the scalps uttered loud shouts of laughter .
she had known him from the time he had left his father's lodge, and had watched his movements .

upon an island in the centre of his realm of water .
she would return to her village .
cut off red head's head with the blade of grass .

the figure and manners, the countenance, and more especially the eyes, were beyond a doubt those of a man .
broke his pipe-stem in her face and called her an owl .

glory will depart .
as he had the day before .
by the gentle heaving of his breast .
delighted .
he heard his son talking to himself .
painted with vermilion over all his breast .
the father would not listen to iadilla's requests .

he shall always be the friend of men, and keep near their dwellings .
to make his father amends for it as a harbinger of peace and joy .

surprised .
the charcoal burner .
rare flowers and fruits and singing birds .
they got everything they wanted at the palace .
the wife will be curious what is inside the soup-tureen .
she was thinking about what was inside the soup-tureen .
the woman spoke less and less, and seemed so wretched that her husband grew quite frightened about her .
she refused to eat .
just raise one corner so that she may peep .
to his wife contented and happy .
a small mouse had sprung from the inside of the tureen, and had nearly hit her in the eye .

startled .
the dancer was lifting up one leg so high in the air that the tin-soldier couldn't find the other leg anywhere .
the dancer .
the tin-soldier thought that she, too, had only one leg .
the castle .
the window flew open and out fell the little tin-soldier, head over heels, from the third-story window .

began to play at visiting, dancing, and fighting .
he loved the dancer .
it would not have been fitting for a soldier .
the country was divided between the old beliefs of paganism and the new doctrines of the christian teaching .
they knew not which way to follow and which to forsake .
spread wider and wider through the land .
the family of murtough .
murtough's three brothers .
murtough .
he was a wild and lawless prince .
in the sunny summer palace of cletty .
cormac .
a pleasure house on the brink of the slow-flowing boyne, near the fairy brugh of angus the ever young, the god of youth and beauty .
sat down to rest upon the fairy mound .
star-bright and beautiful .
a witch woman .
he had scattered and destroyed the ancient peoples of the fairy tribes of erin, her country and her fatherland .
demons .
he being yet a pagan, was still within her power to harm .
their power and their great majesty would depart from them .
angry .
sheen .
on the fairy mound .
her mantle of flowing green .
sheen went softly and sat down beside murtough on the turfy hunting mound .
wonder .
at one moment all his nature was filled with longing and with love of her, so that it seemed to him that he would give the whole of ireland for the loan of one hour's space of dalliance with her; but after that he felt a dread of her, because he knew his fate was in her hands, and that she had come to work him ill .
she was the beloved of murtough .
glad .
she appeared to him so fair that the king was ready to promise her anything in life she wished, so long as she would go with him to cletty of the boyne .
cletty of the boyne .
take her to his house .
murtough feared that when those that were of the christian faith were put out of his house, she would work her spells upon him, and no power would be left with him to resist those spells .
her name must never be uttered, nor must any man or woman learn it .
for 'storm' .
he brought her to his home, and drove out the clerics that were there, with his wife and children along with them, and drove out also the nobles of his own clan, the children of niall, two great and gallant battalions .
duivsech .
bishop cairnech, the half-brother of her husband .
she might obtain help and shelter from him .
her heart was lifted within her, and "fair as a fairy palace is this house of cletty," said she .
robed himself in all the splendour of his royal dignity .
never on earth was to be seen a woman more goodly of appearance than she .
it seemed to him that the power of a great goddess of the ancient time was in her .
he feared her, feeling that his fate was in her hands .
she knew that the king was in their power, now that she was there alone with him, and the clerics and the christian teachers gone .
like thee, a daughter of the race of men of the ancient family of adam and of eve; fit and meet my comradeship with thee .
men fiercely fighting in conflict .
she took of the water of the boyne and made a magic wine thereout .
she took ferns and spiked thistles and light puff-balls of the woods, and out of them she fashioned magic swine and sheep and goats .
all their strength went from them .
at one side of the house .
these were headless men, fighting like human beings, yet finished at the neck .
murtough, in his sleep and in his dreams, heard the battle-shout .
the wine overcame him, and his strength departed from him, and he fell helplessly upon the floor .
the phantoms were but stones and sods and withered leaves of the forest that he took for fighting men .
to arise and to gather together the clans of the children of his people, the men of owen and of niall .
angry .
the clans of owen and of niall .
they returned to their own country .
to seek murtough .
sheen threw her spell upon the king, so that he could not break away .
so that the king would not dare to go out amongst them .
she went everywhere throughout the house, and took lighted brands and burning torches, and scattered them in every part of the dwelling .
the king had spoken her name, for she knew by that that the hour of her revenge had come .
he heard the crash of falling timbers and the noise of the magic hosts, and he smelled the strong smell of fire in the palace .
she caused a great snowstorm to come round the house so that drifts of deep snow were piled against the walls, blocking the doors and chilling the folk that were feasting within the house .
he slept again and he saw a vision .
her eyrie on the dismal cliff outhanging o'er the ocean .
murtough and the griffin were enveloped in the flame .
he made one plunge forward seeking for the magic hosts .
murtough's corpse .
tuilen .
weakness came upon her she leaned her back against the ancient tree that is in aenech reil .
she struck her hands together and she made a great and mournful lamentation .
near the north side of the little church that is in tuilen .
a lonely woman .
sheen, the daughter of sige, the son of dian, from whom ath sigi or the 'ford of sige' .
murtough of the many deeds, of the race of conn and niall, high king of ireland and of the west .
murtough slew her father, and her mother and sister were slain along with him, in the battle of cerb upon the boyne, and there was none of my house to avenge their death .
she made for him magic drink and food which took his strength away .
they wrote them and revised them in a book .
confused .
she wanted to be in a disguise .
she wanted revenge against murtough .
surprised .
devastated .
she did not want to be targeted .
fearful .
he wanted to see her powers .
they will be terrified by the battalions .
she suspected the new bride was trouble .
he tried to invade the fort .
they tried to save murtough .

angry .
took his golden armlet and struck him on the forehead with it .
hasten to notscha's father li dsing and demand that notscha be delivered up to him .
angry .
told him to prevent the dragon-king from accusing him in heaven .
by the gate of heaven .
threw the dragon to the ground with his armlet, and began to pitch into him .
promised notscha that he would not complain of him .
swore that would punish li dsing in a terrible manner .
all the dragon kings of the four seas .
sad .
he wanted to save his parents .
appeared to his mother in a dream .
the spiritual part of notscha, his soul fluttered about in the air, and was driven by the wind to the cave of the great one .
must build a shrine for notscha on a green mountain cliff .
erected a temple for notscha without li dsing's knowledge .
angry .
he brought misfortune to his parents when he was alive .
drew forth his whip, beat notscha's idolatrous likeness to pieces with it, had the temple burned down, and the worshipers mildly reproved .
sad .
made a body of lotus-plants, gave it the gift of life, and enclosed the soul of notscha within i .
a bag of panther-skin in which to keep his armlet and his silken cloth .
li dsing destroyed notscha's temple .
mutscha .
a violent quarrel took place between the brothers; they began to fight, and mutscha was overcome; while notscha once more rushed in pursuit of li dsing .
stepped back a pace, shook the seven-petaled lotus from his sleeve, and threw it into the air .
he was bound to a golden column with three thongs of gold .
notscha needed to be given a severe lesson .
the old buddha of the radiance of the light .
three goblets of the wine of the gods to drink, and three fire-dates to eat .
scared .
he suddenly heard a crash at his left side and another arm grew out from it .
which of the two had the stupidest husband .
unlike most women who think that anything that belongs to them must be better than anyone else, they each thought their own husband was more foolish than the other .
because he declared it was a shorter way than through the door .
he praises his wife and says that he begins to see something .
to cut and stitch .
it is not very warm .
because it is a fine clothing and it should not be as thick as the rough clothes that the husband wears every day .
because his wife looked at him with a look of terror .
because he was certain that he had something dreadful the matter with him .
a drink made up of dried herbs .
a cold shiver when through his body and he was well .
nothing .
they could not decide on it .
delightfully cold .
the sun .
the full moon rose .
move away from that place .
because he was quite hoarse .
the sun .
to sleep .
a forest of white coral .
diamonds .
a young girl and a young man .
the yard-dog had been there longer than the snow man .
she stroked his back many times .
he was only born yesterday .
yesterday .
in a velvet-covered chair, up at the master's house .
the housekeeper's room .
the stove .
he had to .
he kicked away the bone i was gnawing .
the flames darted out of its mouth .
stove sick .
the snow man decreased .
a stove scraper .
the girls in the house .
along the yangtze-kiang .
they were so close to the water .
aduan .
sad .
met two men who took him along with them and saw a new world in the midst of the waters of the yellow river .
sat down and had aduan show his tricks .
taught him the dance of the flying thunders of tsian-tang river and the music that calms the winds on the sea of dung-ting .
hold a review of his dancers .
beat upon enormous cymbals .
tremendous waves spouted up to the very skies, and then fell down again like star-glimmer which scatters in the air .
hastily bade the dance cease, and had the dancers of the nightingale round step forth .
the swallow dancers .
the prince of the dragon cave was especially desirous of testing aduan .
he wanted to meet rose of evening .
a garment of five colors and a carbuncle set in golden threads of fish-beard for a hair-jewel .
the strict rules allowed no confusion in the ranks .
a coral pin fall from her hair .
unhappy .
he will be sick with longing .
she was also sick .
a lotus field .
he met rose of evening at the lotus field .
sad .
the king had kept back rose of evening and one of the nightingale dancers to teach the girls in his castle .
tear his beautiful garments, take his gold and his pearls, and go out with the sole idea of following his beloved in death .
he will return to his home .
joy .
carried to the surface, and the waves carried and cradled her till a ship came by and took her aboard .
aduan's old mother cherished the hope that, after all, perhaps her son had not died .
aduan .
aduan did not cast a shadow .
she was a good little girl - only she was always losing her pocket-handkerchiefs .
three handkins and a pinny .
because she thought she saw some white things spread upon the grass .
clothes-props cust from bracket stems, with lines of plaited rushes, and heap of tiny clothes pis .
flaged floor and wooden beams .
her print gown was tucked up, and she was wearing a large apron over her striped petticoat. her little black nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and underneath her cap--where lucie had yellow curls--that little person had prickles! .
cock robin .
jenny wren .
tom titmouse .
peter rabbit and benjamin bunny .
they felt very obliged to dear mrs. tiggy-winkle .
in a city in the neighborhood of kaiutschou .
saw a man in a red hat dressed as a constable .
the stranger .
the king of the nether world could no come to a decision in the case .
ordered that wang's property and life be shortened .
the man had been sent out by the judge of the dead to fetch him .
spirits only fed on odors .
taianfu, the city near the great mountain .
wang will die .
the inn-keeper's mother .
sad .
told the inn-keeper's mother to ask his wife .
wang will want to disclose his master's crimes to the state .
the officer will be condemned to death .
an inn .
stand by dung's bedside, give him his hand, and ask how things had gone with him since he had last seen him .
his sentence had already been spoken .
this man pretended to be conscientious, and traitorously brought about the death of his friend .
obtain a place for dung as constable in the nether world .
proud .
because it was cracked and riveted .
the lid's imperfections .
a spout .
because it has a spout .
the spout and handle snapped off .
as a flower pot .
glad .
the flower deserved a better pot .
a flower .
because it wasn't good enough for the flower .
she wanted to have quite a tiny, little child, but she did not know where to get one from .
went home and planted the barley-corn .
excited .
thumbelina .
an old toad .
she wanted have a beautiful wife for her son .
scared .
put her at once on a broad water-lily leaf in the stream .
she can't run away from them there .
a great wide stream, with slippery and marshy banks .
the guest-chamber under the marsh .
the old toad wanted thumbelina to marry her son .
the fish will help her escape from the toads .
they thought thumbelina was so pretty that they were very sorry she should go down with the ugly toad to live .
need to find a place to stay .
she had not had anything to eat for the last two days .
piled up the down more closely over the poor swallow, fetched her own coverlid and laid it over his head .
she had to live underground where the sun never shone, and she could not help bursting into tears .
took his golden crown from off his head and put it on hers, asking her her name, and if she would be his wife .
a pig .
so money can slip through .
the nursery .
proud .
there were so many other things to talk about .
a large doll .
excited .
they can't all be noble, some have to be workers .
the money-pig .
he's high up and they didn't think he would hear .
a tea party and discussion .
stiff and proud .
applaud, stamp, and crack .
they were only painted on one side .
add them to his will .
on the ground .
he broke into pieces .
he didn't have a thing inside him yet .
amused .
goody .
they made several journey and picked quanitites of nuts .
because they cannot remember the place .
silvertail .
there is no meaning .
they rushed upon timmy tiptoes and cuffed and scratched him and upset his bag of nuts .
he lay quite stunned and still .
lonely and unhappy .
it lent him its nightcap and the house of full of provisions .
he was confined to the bed .
because she had always douted how they could be got out again .
under a tree root .
he caught a cold .
they fastened them up with a little padlock .
